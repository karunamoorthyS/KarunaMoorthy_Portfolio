## *Musical-Instrument-Identification-with-Supervised-Learning*

The classification of musical instruments using supervised learning is studied. A combined feature set including psychoacoustically relevant spectral features is used. A fairly small dataset consisting of 496 sound examples from 4 instruments - violin, clarinet, saxophone and bassoon is used. Perfect classification accuracy is achieved on the test set with multi-class logistic regression and SVM with RBF kernel.
